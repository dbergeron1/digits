# digits

Standard feedforward neural networks with fully connected layers trained for digits recognition with the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It is essentially a C++ version of Michael Nielsen's Python code used in his online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). The backpropagation routine has additional matrix optimizations using the [armadillo library](http://arma.sourceforge.net/), which results in a 3.5 factor in execution speed compared to the Python code.
