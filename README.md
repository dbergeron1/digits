# digits

Feedforward neural networks that recognizes digits. It is essentially a C++ version of Michael Nielsen's Python code used in his online book: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), but the backpropagation routine is optimized to use less loops and more matrix-wise operations, which are performed using the [armadillo library](http://arma.sourceforge.net/).
